# Keylogger

A simple keylogger is a program designed to record and log keystrokes or keypresses made by a user on a computer or device.

How to Use :
1. Run the keylogger script in the terminal.
2. Once executed, the keylogger will execute each letter that has been pressed on the keyboard and record it in a file that has been pathed in the code.
3. Good luck.
